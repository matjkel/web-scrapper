<h4> Scrapping dynamic SPAs with CasperJS </h4>

<h4> Dependencies: </h4>
<p> If you don't already have Phantom.js, install it. I recommend homebrew </p>
<p> brew install phantomjs -g </p>
<p> npm install </p>

<h5>What you can do with this: </h5>
<ul>
  <li> find favorite website that has dynamically loaded html</li>
  <li> ask yourself, "what content do I want to scrape" </li>
  <li> clone this repo to your local machine</li>
  <li> plug in relevant html </li>
  <li> scrape responsibly </li>
</ul>
